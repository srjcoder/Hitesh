when i tried to commit one file after added that, it asked me to config the global id so i did.

then it said to reset all my activities.

23-10-21:
today i tried git with many tutorials, i came to know about 

add - upload into git as many as wanted
status - to know whether having or not
commit - to give name or identity of works for history
init - create a empty or existence checking process 
clone - of make copy to another repo
log - to review all my histories 
checkout - replace into old stage.

and their usages 

In tutorials " touch " command would used to create new empty file and also to gain access of date, time and modification but those will only support on Linux based, so for window there is no equanlent job

use doc to understand the proccess.

GIT <cmd>
init = 

add = after add cmd we can add no of files manually or just put " . " so it will cover all.

commit = after commit we use - a [which will open discription in vs], - m [helps to write new discription], 

checkout = <hashcode of log>[it reverse all back before that commit]
